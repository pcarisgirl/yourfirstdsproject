## Features
- Data loading and inspection
- Exploratory data analysis with visualizations
- Data preprocessing (handling missing values, splitting data)
- Training multiple classifiers (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, SVM)
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/pcarisgirl/yourfirstdsproject.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
   ```

### Running the Project
Open `yourfirstdsproject.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook and run the cells step by step.

## Results
The notebook compares several classification algorithms and visualizes their performance. The best model is selected based on accuracy.
